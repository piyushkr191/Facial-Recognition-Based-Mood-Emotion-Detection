# Facial_Recognition_Based_Mood_Detection

This project is a facial recognition-based application that detects and classifies human emotions by analyzing facial expressions. The application processes images to identify emotions and leverages machine learning for accuracy and efficiency.

---

## Features

- **Facial Recognition**: Identifies and tracks faces from the input images.
- **Mood Detection**: Classifies human emotions into predefined categories.
- **Machine Learning**: Utilizes trained models to analyze facial features.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Allows users to interact easily with the application.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Built with React.js for a dynamic and responsive user interface.
- **Backend**: Flask framework for handling server-side logic and APIs.
- **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow and Keras for training and deploying the emotion detection model.
- **Database**: SQLite for user and data management.
- **Other Tools**: OpenCV for image processing and face detection.
